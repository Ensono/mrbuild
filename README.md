# Overview

MRBuild (Mono Repo Build) is a cross platform tool to detect changes in a repo and build the appropriate package. It has been inspired by the NX Affected command.

The aim of the tool is to fix an issue when using GitHub repositories with Azure DevOps and needing required builds on a PR.

Please refer to the main [documentation](docs/index.adoc) for more information.
