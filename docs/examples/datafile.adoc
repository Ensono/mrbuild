=== Running using a data file

Using a data file, instead of letting `mrbuild` run a Git command can be favourable in certain situations, for example running a dry run on a different machine to the source code.

NOTE: This example assumes that the data file is called `gitoutput.txt` and is in the current directory.

./mrbuild affected -c ./mrbuild.yaml --datafile ./gitputput.txt --dryrun

As can be seen from the screenshot the application provides information about the command that would be run, which project and from which directory it would be run from.
